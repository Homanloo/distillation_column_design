# Hydraulic and Mechanical Design of a Distillation Column with MS Excel

In this project, by using the given properties of an unknown composition, an optimal hydralic and mechanical design for the distillation column is offered. By calculating parameters such as tray spacing and diameter, and by eliminating unsuitable options by checking weeping and pressure drop, the optimal parameters are calculated. Then, a detailed design of the trays and the shell are drawn using AutoCAD. Finally, a weight and cost estimation is done with the help of equations and graphs suggested by the references. All the equations, graphs, and necessary explanations are included in the excel file, so make sure to check it out!<br><br>
